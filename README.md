I'm interested in the game programming so the assets are not great

CQ App is my biggest project so far, related to a beta game from supercell

Game 1 is a space invaders style

Game 3 is a simple platformer

Tower defense is just a prototype, didn't want to add levels

Water and Fire are the first 3 levels remade from the original game

Endless runner is a prototype
