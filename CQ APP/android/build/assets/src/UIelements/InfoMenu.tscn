New (if you had the app before, u should read only this):
   - load image from your phone, so you don't have to go to cq and to simulator too many times
   - option to see your trooops attacking, to have an idea when u want to use spells, etc.
   - the new troop, new buildings, new spell and tactic added
   - changed a bit the ui, look ugly but that's all I can do :)
   - press on the skeleton to go down/up
   - use item activation button or hold on alt if you are on pc to change the charging bomb turns from bomb miner
Settings:
  - see dead buildings option is to see how much damage was wasted on the last hit, it could be useful fore some people
  - deselect books/spells manually, so u can use them in a row

Tactics/Spells:
   - you have unlimited spells/tactics
   - you should press the save button from the setting to save the spells levels, you change the levels by pressing on the lvl

Troops proprieties:
   - first you should add your items lvls, troops lvls and then save, after that you can try multiple items and other troops/items without needing to change it to normal before leaving the application
   - the troops pathfinding is wrong, what does it mean: instead of targeting the closest building, sometime they wont target it

Buildings:
   - if you press on the building hp you can change it
   - you can put them on the walls spot and the walls on the buildings spot, it's not a bug, just for fun :)

The items not supported (maybe they are more and some of them could be added later):
   - Fire Bow
   - Dodgy Dagger
   - Defensive Blade
   - Explosive Gloves
   - Revenge Gloves
   - Rage Gauntlet
   - Zap Bomb
   - Fire Bomb

The items activation:
   - press on the \"item activation\" button, then press on a troop, when you finish press again on the button
   - ALT + Left click on a troop to activate/deactivate the item ability

Delete a troop/building:
   - CTRL + Left click on a troop to delete it
   - press on the \"delete\" button, then press on a troop/building, when you finish press again on the button

Undo:
   - Press \"undo\"/ctrl + z button to go back, you can go back only when you use a spell or a combo (same for redo, ctrl + shift + z)

* if you want to put a goblin/ fire spirit you can add another building and change the hp (that's how it works at the moment, it wont work fine with the giants, but with the giants you can add goblin storages)
* the app is made to simulate the damage, it wont simulate the changes of items activation, you should do it manually
* if you find any bugs, please dm me so I can solve them"
